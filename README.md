# the-beginning-of-life
OK so basically this is going to be the beginning of whatever the heck I wanna do...?
hi i bet you're reading this well I have 2 ideas for projects
  Mech Combat VR Game
  and
  2D Shoot 'Em Up (yeah I know overdone)
  
  One thing I know is that if I don't start on at least one of these, I'm too preoccupied with greek stuffs, but I won't let that get to me. Time is slow, maybe I'll work on something else? IDK Yet, I've gotta figure it out.
  
  If you're reading this, what's up?
  
  My name is AmitieFromPuyoPuyo. Amitie is a character in Puyo Puyo, and she's pretty cool tbh. That's why I named myself after her.
  
  that's all
  
  (yes I changed this readme bc it was not very presentable before)
