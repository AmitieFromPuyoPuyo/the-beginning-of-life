# the-beginning-of-life
OK so basically this is going to be the beginning of whatever the heck I wanna do...?
hi i bet you're reading this well idk what the FUCK i'm gonna be doing in here but i am
one thing i legitimately want to do is start on 2 projects
  Mech Combat VR Game
  and
  Yandere Simulator (but like... a re-creation of it)
  
  One thing I know is that if I don't start on at least one of these, I'm doomed for great failure, and I'll never become the person I want to become.
  Anyways, let's get started.
  
  If you're reading this, what's up.
  
  My name is AmitieFromPuyoPuyo. Amitie is a character known for basically being a friend. I'm a friend (I guess) soooooooooooo yeah
